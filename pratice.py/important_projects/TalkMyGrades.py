'''üß† Project: Voice-Based Student Report Card Generator
üìù Description:
This project will:

Ask user for student details (name, subjects, marks).

Use a loop to enter multiple subjects and marks.

Use conditional logic to assign grades.

Use OOP to define a Student class.

Use pyttsx3 to read out the report card.'''

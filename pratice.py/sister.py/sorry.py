I never wanted to see you upset â€” you mean too much to me. You're not just a friend, you're like the sister my heart chose. If my joke broke your trust, I want to fix it with my honesty and love. Please forgive me, your silly brother who sometimes makes mistakes but never stops caring for you",

You're one of the most precious people in my life â€” a sister not by blood, but by bond. I miss your smile, your laugh, and the warmth of our friendship. Please forgive me for being careless. Your happiness means more to me than any joke ever could.",
            "My dear sister, I'm sorry from the deepest corner of my heart. The prank was stupid, and I realize now that it wasn't funny â€” it was hurtful. I feel ashamed for turning a moment of joy into discomfort for you. I promise, from now on, my actions will always respect the love and care we share. Please forgive your emotional brother who just wants to see you smile again.",
